# E-Buddy for Child Labour
*Smart India Hackathon 2022 Winner*

It is a Online Child Labour Complaint Portal.

## Tech Stack Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Redux, Razorpay, Material UI, React Router

## Why This Project?

- The Current Portal(PENCIL) for child labour complaint is difficult to navigate.
- To file a single complaint the user have to fill more than **20 mandatory** fields.
- The complaints filed by a user are left unseen and no proper steps were being taken.


## How we solved?

- We have made a user friendly website.
- The  **20 mandatory** fields fields have been reduced and brought down to only  **2 mandatory** fields i.e **Email id & Image**
  This was a huge optimization from user's POV who is even willing to file a complaint
-  A proper connection was set up b/w Police, Nodal Officers and NGOs.
-  We kept All the data/Status of Child transparent to both the User who reported the Child and the Officers involved.
-  Financial, Housing, Schooling and other supports were provided to the child.
