      <h1>National Child Labour Project SCHEME</h1>
      <h2>Objective of the Scheme:</h2>
      <p>
        This is the major Central Sector Scheme for the rehabilitation of child
        labour. The Scheme seeks to adopt a sequential approach with focus on
        rehabilitation of children working in hazardous occupations & processes
        in the first instance. Under the Scheme, survey of child labour engaged
        in hazardous occupations & processes has been conducted. The identified
        children are to be withdrawn from these occupations & processes and then
        put into special schools in order to enable them to be mainstreamed into
        formal schooling system. Project Societies at the district level are
        fully funded for opening up of special schools/Rehabilitation Centres
        for the rehabilitation of child labour. The special
        schools/Rehabilitation Centres provide: Non-formal/bridge education
        Skilled/vocational training Mid Day Meal Stipend @ Rs.150/- per child
        per month. Health care facilities through a doctor appointed for a group
        of 20 schools.

        to identify children working in hazardous occupations and processes.
        These children will then form the target group for the project society.

        be mainstreamed directly to formal educational system through the SSA.
        Working children in the age group of 9- 14 years will have to be
        rehabilitated through NCLP schools established by the Project Society.
        Project Implementation: The entire project is required to be implemented
        through a registered society under the Chairmanship of administrative
        head of the district, namely, District Magistrate/Collector/Dy.

        concerned Government Departments, representatives of Panchayati Raj
        Institutions, NGOs, Trade Unions, etc. Funding pattern: The projects
        have been taken up in the Central Sector, the entire funding is done by
        the Central Government (Ministry of Labour & Employment). Funds are
        released to the concerned Project Societies depending upon the progress
        of project activities. Present Status of NCLP Scheme: At present about
        6000 special schools are in operation under NCLP scheme. As on date more
