            Child workers in the identified target area The overall approach of
            the project is to create an enabling environment in the target area,
            where children are motivated and empowered through various measures
            to enroll in schools and refrain from working, and households are
            provided with alternatives to improve their income levels. NCLPS
            will be implemented in close coordination with State, District
            administration and Civil society. Elimination of Child Labour is
            joint responsibility of the Ministry of Labour and Employment and
            the State Governments. Other stakeholders such as District
            Administrations, local communities, civil society groups, NGOâ€Ÿs,
            academicians and enforcement agencies have an important role to
            play. The scheme seeks to not only set up the implementation
            structure but also institutionalize monitoring and supervision for
            effective functioning of the scheme. NCLPS is a central sector
            scheme where 100% of the funding is provided by the Government of
            India through the Ministry of Labour and Employment. Funds under the
            existing NCLP scheme are released by the Central Government directly
            to the registered NCLP District Project Society under the
            chairpersonship of the administrative head of the district namely
            District Magistrate/District Collector (DM/DC)/Deputy Commissioner
            of the district who is under administrative control of the State
            Govt.
