      <h1>About National Child Labour Project</h1>
      <p>
        The NCLP Scheme seeks: A. To eliminate all forms of child labour through
        i) Identification and withdrawal of all children in the Project Area
        from child labour, ii) Preparing children withdrawn from work for
        mainstream education alongwith vocational training; iii) Ensuring
        convergence of services provided by different government
        departments/agencies for the benefit of child and their family; B. To
        contribute to the withdrawal of all adolescent workers from Hazardous
        Occupations / Processes and their skilling and integration in
        appropriate occupations through i) Identification and withdrawal of all
        adolescent workers from hazardous occupations / processes, ii)
        Facilitating vocational training opportunities for such adolescents
        through existing scheme of skill developments; C. Raising awareness
        amongst stakeholders and target communities, and orientation of NCLP and
        other functionaries on the issues of 'child labour' and 'employment of
        adolescent workers in hazardous occupations/processes'; and D. Creation
        of a Child Labour Monitoring, Tracking and Reporting System. The scheme
        focuses on: i) All child workers below the age of 14 years in the
        identified target area. ii) Adolescent workers below the age of 18 years
        in the target area engaged in hazardous occupations / processes iii)
        Families of Child workers in the identified target area The overall
        approach of the project is to create an enabling environment in the
        target area, where children are motivated and empowered through various
        measures to enroll in schools and refrain from working, and households
        are provided with alternatives to improve their income levels. NCLPS
        will be implemented in close coordination with State, District
        administration and Civil society. Elimination of Child Labour is joint
        responsibility of the Ministry of Labour and Employment and the State
        Governments. Other stakeholders such as District Administrations, local
        communities, civil society groups, NGOâ€Ÿs, academicians and enforcement
        agencies have an important role to play. The scheme seeks to not only
        set up the implementation structure but also institutionalize monitoring
        and supervision for effective functioning of the scheme. NCLPS is a
        central sector scheme where 100% of the funding is provided by the
        Government of India through the Ministry of Labour and Employment. Funds
        under the existing NCLP scheme are released by the Central Government
        directly to the registered NCLP District Project Society under the
        chairpersonship of the administrative head of the district namely
        District Magistrate/District Collector (DM/DC)/Deputy Commissioner of
        the district who is under administrative control of the State Govt.
